Wow.. my original plan was to attempt to break the ecb after detecting which one it was..
but it seems I'll just have to detect it.

This should be pretty easy.. provivded there is enough repetition in the actual line

Loop through first, attempting to locate a 16 byte match.

If one and only one exists... that's probably the one.
